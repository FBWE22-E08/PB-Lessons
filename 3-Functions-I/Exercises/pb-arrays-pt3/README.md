# Arrays | Part 3

- Work from the `solution.js` file provided in this repository.

**1. Where Have My Four Letter Words Gone?**
Create a function named `isFourLetters` that takes an array of strings. Return an array with all the words in the given array that are exactly four letters long.

Examples:

- isFourLetters(["John", "James", "Jack", "Jeanne"]) ➞ ["John", "Jack"]
- isFourLetters(["Tomato", "Corn", "Lettuce"]) ➞ ["Corn"]
- isFourLetters(["Dog", "Cat", "Deer"]) ➞ ["Deer"]

**2. Print Month Name.**
Create a function named `getMonthName` that takes a number between 1 and 12, and returns its corresponding month name as a string.

Examples:

- getMonthName(3) ➞ "March"
- getMonthName(12) ➞ "December"
- getMonthName(6) ➞ "June"

**3. Being unique is cool...**
Create a function named `unique` that takes an array of numbers and returns the unique numbers.

Examples:

- unique([3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3]) ➞ [7]
- unique([0, 0, 0.77, 0, 0, 5]) ➞ [0.77, 5]
- unique([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ [0]

**4. c4n y0u r34d th15?**
Create a function named `code` that takes a string as an argument and returns a coded (h4ck3r 5p34k) version of the string.

**PS:** for your program to work properly, the function should replace all 'a's with 4, 'e's with 3, 'i's with 1, 'o's with 0, and 's's with 5.

Examples:

- code("javascript is cool") ➞ "j4v45cr1pt 15 c00l"
- code("programming is fun") ➞ "pr0gr4mm1ng 15 fun"
- code("become a coder") ➞ "b3c0m3 4 c0d3r"
